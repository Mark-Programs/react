This React JS application is based off a video on the JavaScript Mastery's YouTube channel.
Navigate to the video using this address: https://youtu.be/b9eMGE7QtTk

I have tweaked the code and styling just because I could.  I like messing around with stuff.
This is my very first application using React JS.  Feel free to compare it to their full Movie App code,
which is listed in the description of the YouTube video.


Create React environment
  Requirements: NodeJS
  Command: npx create-react-app ./

Intro text generated after React installation:
  npm start         -Starts the development server.
  npm run build     -Bundles the app into static files for production.
  npm test          -Starts the test runner.
  npm run eject     -Removes this tool and copies build dependencies, configuration files
                      and scripts into the app directory. If you do this, you canâ€™t go back!
  
This will state there are vulnerabilities, but being this is a demo app, it is okay to ignore them.
